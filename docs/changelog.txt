- Fixed a serious bug where RPC4Django relied on 
  ``request.META['CONTENT_TYPE']`` to be set by the web server
- Added generator tag to the template with RPC4Django and the version
- Renamed ``RPC4DJANGO_RESTRICT_DOCUMENTATION`` to 
  :envvar:`RPC4DJANGO_RESTRICT_METHOD_SUMMARY` for clarity

  SimpleXMLRPCDispatcher's XML output
